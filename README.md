# Boggle

A Programming-1 curriculum assignment at FIEA, UCF. Simulate a Boggle game board and search all words on the game board for a given dictionary file within a second.

### The instructions for the assignment were as follows:

For this assignment, you are creating the game boggle. If you don't know the basic rules of the game, checkout this video:

[How To Play Boggle](http://www.ehow.com/video_4414543_play-words-can-use-boggle.html)

You must create the gameboard (4x4 or 5x5, switchable by a #define) randomly out of the dice I give you. Randomize both the position of the dice, as well as the letter facing up on the die. Then write an algorithm that goes through and finds all the words in the gameboard. I am providing a dictionary with all of the approved words. Use my shell program to write your code so we all have the same timing start/stop points. You must have the functions I provide in the template, even if you decide to do nothing in them.

**FAQ** - 

- Is there a minimum word length? Yes, 4. I recommend removing all words in the dictionary shorter than 4 letters in length.

- Is there a prize? No.

- Is there a minimum time all words must be found in? Yes, you should be able to find all the words in a 5x5 board in well under 1 second.

- What are you providing us for this assignment? .zip attached to assignment.

- Is the Q die actually Qu, not Q? Yes, treat the Q letter as Qu.

### Additional Information:

- **dictionary.txt** is the given dictionary file.

- **Boggle.cpp** is the file with the main method.
